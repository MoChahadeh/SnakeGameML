# SnakeGameML
Attempting to teach a neural net to play snake

## Introduction
This was my attempt in teaching a neural network built from scratch and evolved using a genetic algorithm, to play the classic Snake Game. Spoiler Alert it was a success.. :)

## The Game
stay alive as long as possible by eating the food and avoiding hitting yourself or the edges of the game, the game was built from scrarch in pygame for python.

## The Neural network
I built the neural network from scratch in python using the classic numpy and simple math. in this case I used an input layers of 12 neurons, ONE hidden layer of 18 neurons, and an output layer of 4 neurons as the structure of the neural network.
